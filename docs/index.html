                <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    Tanjiro Kamado is a kind-hearted and intelligent boy who lives with his family in the mountains. He
                    has become his family's sole source of income after the passing of his father, making trips to the
                    nearby village to sell charcoal. Everything changes when he comes home one day to discover that his
                    family has been attacked and slaughtered by a demon. Tanjiro and his sister Nezuko are the sole
                    survivors of the incident, with Nezuko being transformed into a demon, but still surprisingly
                    showing signs of human emotion and thought. After an encounter with Giyū Tomioka, a demon slayer,
                    Tanjiro is recruited by him and sent to be taught by Sakonji Urokodaki, another member of the Demon
                    Slayer Corps, to also become a demon slayer, and begins his quest to help his sister turn human
                    again and avenge the deaths of the rest of his family.

                <h2>Movie</h2>
                <p>
                    The movie fully adapts the Mugen Train Arc of the manga.
                    Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train is a follow-up to the extremely popular TV
                    series Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba (2019) that premiered in April 2019 and was based on Koyoharu
                    Gotouge's comic, which boasts over 100 million copies in circulation in Japan. Featuring animation
                    production from revered animation studio Ufotable, the story follows Tanjiro Kamado's journey as a
                    demon slayer after his family is brutally murdered and his sister is turned into a demon. The film
                    opens as Tanjiro and his comrades have completed their rehabilitation training at the Butterfly
                    Mansion, and they arrive at their next mission on the Mugen Train, where over forty people have
                    disappeared in a very short span of time. Tanjiro and Nezuko, along with Zenitsu and Inosuke, join
                    one of the most powerful swordsmen of the Demon Slayer Corps, Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku, to face
                    the demon aboard the Mugen Train, on track to despair.

                        <p class="card-text">The oldest son of a charcoal-seller. His entire family was massacred while he was selling charcoal, with only his sister Nezuko surviving. To find a cure to turn her back into a human, he decides to join the Demon Slayer Corps. He initially learnt the "Water Breathing" sword-style, but later he began to use his family's "Dance of the Fire God" technique, which itself is based on the original breath style, the Sun Breathing. </p>

                            of her memories to keep herself from killing Tanjiro. Due to two years of hypnotic
                            conditioning by Urokodaki, Nezuko regards all humans as her family and will mercilessly
                            attack any demon that threatens them. Instead of consuming human flesh, Nezuko regains
                            energy from sleep. She was unable to speak and must wear a bamboo gag to keep from biting
                            anyone. </p>

                            "Thunder Breathing" style by the former Thunder Hashira, but was only able to learn the
                            first technique, and because of this he often belittles himself, despite the fact that he is
                            talented. He joins up with Tanjiro on a mission and since then, they are teammates. </p>

                            uses a self-taught style called "Beast Breathing", along with two serrated swords in battle.
                            He wears a boar's head mask and reacts very violently. At first, he saw Tanjiro as an enemy,
                            but they quickly become friends and teammates. </p>
